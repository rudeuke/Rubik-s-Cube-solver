# Rubik-s-Cube-solver
Arduino based robot

Work in progress...

For now there is full movement handling, including execution of sequence of moves. The notation of double and reverse rotations has been is slightly modified for the convenience of work.

Cube orientation tracking doesn't work propetly. Need to be fixed.

There are many upgrades planned to be done in the future.
